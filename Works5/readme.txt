Using an appropriate file structure, write a program that defines a Shape class with a constructor that gives
values to properties width and height. Then define two sub - classes: Triangle and Rectangle.Define
a method, area(), that calculates the area of the shape.In the application file, define instances of
Triangleand Rectangleand then call the area() function for these two objects, ensuring that the
correct values are returned.
To assist, it may be useful to refer to page 632 (pdf p20) for information on redefining functions in child
classes.
